To expose your Jenkins server using ngrok, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Download and install ngrok
- Visit the ngrok website (https://ngrok.com/) and sign up for a free account.
- Download ngrok and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Start ngrok
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where ngrok is installed.
- Run the following command to start ngrok and expose the Jenkins port (default is 8080):
  ```
  ngrok http 8080
  ```

Step 3: Configure Jenkins
- Open your Jenkins dashboard.
- Go to "Manage Jenkins" and click on "Configure Global Security."
- Under "Access Control" > "Security Realm," select "Jenkinsâ€™ own user database."
- Enable the option "Allow users to sign up" and create a new user account if needed.
- Scroll down to "TCP port for JNLP agents" and set it to a fixed port number (e.g., 50000).
- Save the configuration.

Step 4: Update Jenkins URL
- In your Jenkins dashboard, go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."
- Under "Jenkins Location," set the "Jenkins URL" to the ngrok URL provided in the terminal/console where ngrok is running. It will look like `http://randomstring.ngrok.io`.
- Save the configuration.

Step 5: Access Jenkins via ngrok
- In the terminal/console where ngrok is running, you'll see a forwarding URL generated by ngrok (e.g., `Forwarding http://randomstring.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080`).
- Copy the ngrok forwarding URL.
- Open a web browser and paste the ngrok URL. It should take you to your Jenkins server.

Note: The free version of ngrok provides a randomly generated subdomain that changes every time you restart ngrok. If you need a consistent URL, you can consider upgrading to a paid ngrok plan or use alternative methods for exposing your Jenkins server, such as port forwarding on your router or using a static IP address.
